# Chapter 16

## Question 1

### First let’s use a tiny address space to translate some addresses. Here’s a simple set of parameters with a few different random seeds; can you translate the addresses?

```bash
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 0
```

#### VA  0: 0x0000006c (decimal:  108) --> PA or segmentation violation?

1. **Convert the VA into decimal** (108) base 10 = (1101100) base 2

1. **Determine the Segment**
   * (log2(address size) - 1)th bit is the segment bit.
   * In our case 1101100 it is 1 (The bit on the most significat position is segment bit).
   * It is telling that this virtual address is referring to some physical address
     in segment 1.
1. As our desired mem. location is in segment 1 whose growth is negative.
   So, we have to use slightly different formula to get correct offset.

   **Offset = Decimal Representation of (All Bits except Segment Bit (101100)) - Max. Segment**

   * We can calculate max segment value by **2^[log2(address size) - number of segment bits]**

   * Max Segment = 2^(log2(128) - 1) = 2^(7 - 1) = 2^(6) = 64

   So, our Offset calculation is as follow
   * Offset = Decimal Representation of 0b101100 - 64
     * Offset = 44 - 64 = -20

   * Absolute of Offset should be less or equal than Bounds(Limit)
     * |-20| <= 20 True (Valid)

1. **Physical Address = Base + Offset** = 512 - 20 = 492

Answer = VA  0: 0x0000006c (decimal:  108) --> Valid in Segment 1; 0x1ec or in decimal 492

> **VA  1: 0x00000061 (decimal:   97) --> PA or segmentation ?violation?**

VA = 0b1100001

Seg 1

Offset = 33-64 = -31

|-31| > 20

So, Answer = Segmentation Fault

> **VA  2: 0x00000035 (decimal:   53) --> PA or segmentation violation?**

VA = 0b0110101

Seg 0

**Note that the formula for segment 0 is different because its growth is positive.**

Offset = Decimal Representation of (All Bits except Segment Bit

Offset = 53

|53| > 20

So, Answer = Segmentation Fault

> **VA  3: 0x00000021 (decimal:   33) --> PA or segmentation violation?**

VA = 0b0100001

Seg 0

Offset = 33

33 > 20

So, Answer = Segmentation Fault

> **VA  4: 0x00000041 (decimal:   65) --> PA or segmentation violation?**

VA = 0b1000001

Seg 1

Offset = 1 - 64 = -63

|-63| > 20

So, Answer = Segmentation Fault

### :closed_book: Do the Following part yourself

```bash
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 1
```

```bash
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 2
```

## Question 2

### Now, let’s see if we understand this tiny address space we’ve constructed (using the parameters from the question above). What is the highest legal virtual address in segment 0? What about the lowest legal virtual address in segment 1? What are the lowest and highest illegal addresses in this entire address space? Finally, how would you run segmentation.py with the -A flag to test if you are right?

```bash
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 0
```

**Highest Legal VA in Seg 0 = 19**

**Lowest Legal VA in Seg 1 = 108**

**Lowest Illegal VA in Whole Addr. Space = 20**

```bash
./segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 0 -c -A 20
```

**Highest Illegal VA in Whole Addr. Space = 107**

```bash
./segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 0 -c -A 107
```

## Question 3

### Let’s say we have a tiny 16-byte address space in a 128-byte physical memory. What base and bounds would you set up so as to get the simulator to generate the following translation results for the specified address stream: valid, valid, violation, ..., violation, valid, valid? Assume the following parameters:

```bash
segmentation.py -a 16 -p 128
-A 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
--b0 ? --l0 ? --b1 ? --l1 ?
```

**Seg 0 base = 0**

**Seg 0 bound = 2**

**Seg 1 base = 128**

**Seg 1 bound = 2**

```bash
 ./segmentation.py -a 16 -p 128 -A 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 --b0 0 --l0 2 --b1 128 --l1 2 -c
 ```

## Question 4

### Assuming we want to generate a problem where roughly 90% of the randomly-generated virtual addresses are valid (i.e., not segmentation violations). How should you configure the simulator to do so? Which parameters are important?

We just need to set the bounds to be about 90% of the address space. For instance:
```sh
./segmentation.py -a 256 -p 1024 --b0 0 --l0 115 --b1 1024 --l1 115 -c -n 100
```
As (256 * 0.9)/2 ~= 115. Note: we have 2 segments.

## Question 5

### Can you run the simulator such that no virtual addresses are valid? How?

Pretty simple

```bash
./segmentation.py -b 0 -l 0 -B 0 -L 0 -c
```
