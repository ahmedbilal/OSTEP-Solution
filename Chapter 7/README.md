# Chapter 7

## Question 1

### Compute the response time and turnaround time when running three jobs of length 200 with the SJF and FIFO schedulers.
```shell
./scheduler.py -p FIFO -l 200,200,200 -c

ARG policy FIFO
ARG jlist 200,200,200

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 200.0 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 200.00 )
  [ time 200 ] Run job 1 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 400.00 )
  [ time 400 ] Run job 2 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 600.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 200.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 200.00  Turnaround 400.00  Wait 200.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 400.00  Turnaround 600.00  Wait 400.00

  Average -- Response: 200.00  Turnaround 400.00  Wait 200.00
```

```shell
./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 200,200,200 -c

ARG policy SJF
ARG jlist 200,200,200

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 200.0 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 200.00 )
  [ time 200 ] Run job 1 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 400.00 )
  [ time 400 ] Run job 2 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 600.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 200.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 200.00  Turnaround 400.00  Wait 200.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 400.00  Turnaround 600.00  Wait 400.00

  Average -- Response: 200.00  Turnaround 400.00  Wait 200.00
```

## Question 2

### Now do the same but with jobs of different lengths: 100, 200, and 300

```shell
./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 100,200,300 -c
ARG policy SJF
ARG jlist 100,200,300

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 100.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 300.0 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 100.00 secs ( DONE at 100.00 )
  [ time 100 ] Run job 1 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 300.00 )
  [ time 300 ] Run job 2 for 300.00 secs ( DONE at 600.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 100.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 100.00  Turnaround 300.00  Wait 100.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 300.00  Turnaround 600.00  Wait 300.00

  Average -- Response: 133.33  Turnaround 333.33  Wait 133.33
```
```shell
./scheduler.py -p FIFO -l 100,200,300 -c
ARG policy FIFO
ARG jlist 100,200,300

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 100.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 300.0 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 100.00 secs ( DONE at 100.00 )
  [ time 100 ] Run job 1 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 300.00 )
  [ time 300 ] Run job 2 for 300.00 secs ( DONE at 600.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 100.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 100.00  Turnaround 300.00  Wait 100.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 300.00  Turnaround 600.00  Wait 300.00

  Average -- Response: 133.33  Turnaround 333.33  Wait 133.33

```

## Question 3

### Now do the same, but also with the RR scheduler and a time-slice of 1

```shell
./scheduler.py -p RR -q 1 -l 100,200,300 -c
ARG policy RR
ARG jlist 100,200,300

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 100.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 300.0 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job   0 for 1.00 secs
  [ time   1 ] Run job   1 for 1.00 secs
  [ time   2 ] Run job   2 for 1.00 secs
  ...
  [ time 596 ] Run job   2 for 1.00 secs
  [ time 597 ] Run job   2 for 1.00 secs
  [ time 598 ] Run job   2 for 1.00 secs
  [ time 599 ] Run job   2 for 1.00 secs ( DONE at 600.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 298.00  Wait 198.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 1.00  Turnaround 499.00  Wait 299.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 2.00  Turnaround 600.00  Wait 300.00

  Average -- Response: 1.00  Turnaround 465.67  Wait 265.67
```

## Question 4

### For what types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?

SJF always gives the same turnaround time as FIFO except when a shorter job arrives after a longer job.
As long as all job lengths are either equal or arrive in ascending order, the turnaround times will be the same.

## Question 5

### For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SJF deliver the same response times as RR?

If all job length *(say it x)* are same and Quantum length *(say it q)* then x = q. In this case, SJF delivers the same response times as RR.

```shell
./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 100,100,100 -c
```

```shell
./scheduler.py -p RR -l 100,100,100 -c -q 100
```

Both have same response time.

## Question 6

### What happens to response time with SJF as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

If we doubles each job length, average response time also get double too. It mean there is linear relationship between job length and response time.

```shell
./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 1,2,3 -c
```

```shell
./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 2,4,6 -c
```

```shell
./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 4,8,12 -c
```

## Question 7

### What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

Response time increases linearly with quantum length increase.
Let N be the number of jobs and q the quantum length, then the worst-case response time is (N-1)q/2.
